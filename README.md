# javascriptComponents-training
This workshop is intended for KNIME developers who would like to learn how to write native JS nodes instead of writing interfaces on the Generic JS View which is more like a Jupyter notebook. These nodes can be written as an extension of *org.knime.js.core.javascriptComponents*. While this takes a slightly deeper knowledge of KNIME it brings many advantages:

* A big number of ready to be used JS libraries are available already and more are added in each KNIME version.
* The scripts are pure JS and do not contain any KNIME pseudo code for flow variables.
* Scripts can be edited with a fully fledged editor and catch errors before runtime with a linter, etc. 

During this workshop you will create and deploy a JS node with a simple form asking for first and last names.
